This will serve as the main documentation for group 2 and all the group members from group two will add to this file
as need be. This is where our final commits will go as well as our design documentation and any other formal forms
of changes that we add into the final project. We will upload our progress into this file as well to keep track of the
development of the group project. - Chris
